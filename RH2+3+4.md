## Links Between Files
---

You can create multiple file name that point to the same file. These file names are called links. You can create two types of these links: Hard Links & Soft Links. 

### **<span style="color:DodgerBlue">Hard Links:</span>**  
    := Another file that points to the SAME DATA, acting exactly as the original file. After creation there is no difference between original nad new Hard Link file.

### You can determine how many HLs a file has by executing the following command:
![](Images/1.2_HardLink.png)
 &nbsp; 


### To Create a Hard Link: 

### **<span style="color:orange">ln</span>** [ **<span style="color:red">OPTION</span>** ] [ **<span style="color:red">TARGET</span>** ] [ **<span style="color:red">DESTINATION</span>** ]  := Make a new link
```shell
	-b  := make a backup of each existing destination file
    -f  := remove existing destination files
    -i  --interactive := prompt when removing destinations
    -L  --logical     := dereference TARGETs that are symbolic links
    -s  := creates symbolic link 
```
![](Images/1.2_HardLinkGuide.png)


 **To check if there is a *<span style="color:DodgerBlue">Hard Link</span>* between files execute the following command (' ln -i ') and compare the inode numbers (circled in red below).
 
 ![](Images/1.2_HardLinkDetect.png)

 ** Even if the original file is deleted you CAN STILL ACESS THE CONTENTS provided there is at least one other HL that exists. Data is deleted from storage whith the LAST HL. 

### <span style="color:Red">Limitations of Hard Links:</span>
```
    - You can only use Hard Links with regular files (no dir or special files)
    - Can only use HL if both files ARE IN THE SAME FILE SYSTEM (Ex. Diff. Mounted Dir)
```

### **<span style="color:orange">df</span>** := List all dirs on different file systems
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;   

### **<span style="color:DodgerBlue">Symbolic Links:</span>**  
    := Also known as a 'Soft Link' , not a regular file but a special type of file that points to an existing FILE OR DIRECTORY. 

    A symbolic link pointing to a directory ACTS as that directory. So when you switch to the symbolic link it takes to the appropriately linked directory. 

### <span style="color:Green">Advantages Over Hard Links:</span>
```
    - Symbolic links can link two files on different systems
    - Symbolic links can point to a directory or special file, not just to a regular file. 
```
### To Create a Symbolic Link: 
```
    ln -s [OPTIONS] [TARGET] [DESTINATION]
```

![](Images/1.3_SymbolicLinkGuide.png)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;** The '-' missing and 'l' in its place before the symboLink file indicates that it is a <span style="color:DodgerBlue">SYMBOLIC LINK </span>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;** When a file with a symbolic link gets deleted, the <span style="color:DodgerBlue">SYMBOLIC LINK </span> becomes a <span style="color:red">DANGLING SYMBOLIC LINK </span>
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  

### A <span style="color:DodgerBlue">HARD LINK </span> POINTS TO DATA
### A <span style="color:DodgerBlue">SYMBOLIC LINK </span> POINTS A NAME TO ANOTHER NAME
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  

## Match File Names with Shell Expansions:
---
### Pattern Matching:
| Pattern	| Matches |
|-----------|---------|
| *	        | Any string of zero or more characters.
| ?	        |Any single character.
|[abc…​]	     |Any one character in the enclosed class (between the square brackets).
|[!abc…​]	 |Any one character not in the enclosed class.
|[^abc…​]	 |Any one character not in the enclosed class.
|[[:alpha:]]	|Any alphabetic character.
|[[:lower:]]	|Any lowercase character.
|[[:upper:]]	|Any uppercase character.
|[[:alnum:]]	|Any alphabetic character or digit.
|[[:punct:]]	|Any printable character that is not a space or alphanumeric.
|[[:digit:]]	|Any single digit from 0 to 9.
|[[:space:]]	|Any single white space character, which might include tabs, newlines, carriage returns, form feeds, or spaces.
---
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  

### Tilde Expansion:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tilde <span style="color:Yellow">(~) matches the current user's home directory. </span>  If it starts with a string of characters other than slash (/), then the shell interprets the string up to the slash as a user name. 




![](Images/1.4_TildeExpansion.png)

### Brace Expansion:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Used to generate discretionary strings of characters. So basically all strings of characters seperated by a comma, is used to create multiple versions with each string in the brackets:

```
[user@host glob]$ echo {Sunday,Monday,Tuesday,Wednesday}.log
        Sunday.log Monday.log Tuesday.log Wednesday.log

[user@host glob]$ echo file{1..3}.txt
        file1.txt file2.txt file3.txt

[user@host glob]$ echo file{a..c}.txt
        filea.txt fileb.txt filec.txt

[user@host glob]$ echo file{a,b}{1,2}.txt
        filea1.txt filea2.txt fileb1.txt fileb2.txt

[user@host glob]$ echo file{a{1,2},b,c}.txt
        filea1.txt filea2.txt fileb.txt filec.txt
```

### Variable Expansion:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A variable acts like a named container, storing a value in memory. Variables simplify accessing and modifying the stored data either from the command line or within a script. 

#### Declare a Variable:
```shell
[user@host ~]$ VARIABLENAME=value
```

#### Use a Variable:
```shell
[user@host ~]$ USERNAME=operator
[user@host ~]$ echo $USERNAME
    operator
---------------------------------
[user@host ~]$ USERNAME=operator
[user@host ~]$ echo ${USERNAME}
    operator
```

#### Command Subtitution: 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Allows the output of a command to replace the command itself on the command line. Basically enclosing a command in another command. 
```shell
[user@host glob]$ echo Today is $(date +%A).
Today is Wednesday.

[user@host glob]$ echo The time is $(date +%M) minutes past $(date +%l%p).
The time is 26 minutes past 11AM.
```

#### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Escape Characters:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Double Quotations (" ") Marsks Supressing Globbing & Shell Expansion

```
[user@host glob]$ myhost=$(hostname -s); echo $myhost
host

[user@host glob]$ echo "***** hostname is ${myhost} *****"
***** hostname is host *****
```

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Single Quotes (' ') to Interpret ALL TEXT LITERALLY:
```
[user@host glob]$ echo "Will variable $myhost evaluate to $(hostname -s)?"
Will variable host evaluate to host?

[user@host glob]$ echo 'Will variable $myhost evaluate to $(hostname -s)?'
Will variable $myhost evaluate to $(hostname -s)?
```
